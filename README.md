#####Submitted by: Aravind Kumar Ramesh 

The python script is placed under the src folder. The <b>cleaned_tweets.py</b> implements the challenge 1, which is to read the input tweets from json and clean up the tweets of unicode characters. The output is placed under /tweets_output/ft1.txt

The second script <b>average_degree.py</b> computes the average degree of the graph in the 60 seconds window. The output is placed under /tweets_output/ft2.txt. 
Both the scripts can be invoked by running the run.sh on the root directory. Ensure that permisssions are set.
Changes can be made to this script file to set your input and output path. 

##### This script makes use of the following libraries
1. simplejson
2. pandas
3. numpy
